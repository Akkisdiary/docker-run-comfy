- Comments should be easy to understand and should be able to explain the code to a person who is not familiar with the code.
- Only add comments when necessary. Do not add comments to every line of code or self explanatory code.
- Use proper indentation and formatting. Use proper spacing and line breaks.
- Ask questions before making any changes. Ask for permission before making any changes.
