# Rules for writing code

1. Always explain through comments in the code what it does, how it works and why it is necessary.
2. Comments should be easy to understand and should be able to explain the code to a person who is not familiar with the code.
3. Use clear, descriptive variable names.
4. Do not use any marketing jargon.
